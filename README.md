# 3D-CSS-objects

Click/Touch and drag the object to move it around, use sliders at the bottom to rotate, change perspective and scale. 

The goal of this project is to get myself comfortable with CSS3 and JavaScript DOM manipulation before moving on to learning any of the popular JS frameworks/libraries or CSS preprocessors.

More specifically, I'm centering this project around creating 3D objects with mostly just CSS with JavaScript to let users interact with the objects. 

It's still far from what I envision, but it is without a doubt the most fun i've had working on a coding-related project.

Enjoy!
