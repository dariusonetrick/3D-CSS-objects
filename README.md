# 3D-CSS-objects

The goal of this project is to get myself comfortable with CSS3 and JavaScript DOM manipulation before moving on to learning any of the popular JS frameworks or CSS preprocessors.

More specifically, I'm centering this project around creating 3D objects with mostly just CSS with JavaScript to let users interact with the objects. 

It's still far from what I envision, but it is without a doubt the most fun and engaging project i've worked on.

Enjoy!
